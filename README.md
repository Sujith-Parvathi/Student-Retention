# Student-Retention
# Enhancing Higher Education Student Success

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze student dropout rates in higher education institutions using **machine learning classification models**. By identifying key factors contributing to student retention and dropout, universities can implement timely interventions to improve graduation rates and academic success.

## 🎯 Business Question
What are the key factors affecting student retention or dropout rates in academic institutions?

## 🔍 Methodology
- **Dataset**: Contains 4,424 observations and 35 features related to student demographics, academic performance, and socioeconomic factors.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Explored various variables such as age, gender, financial status, attendance, and marital status.
- **Data Processing**: Normalization and feature selection based on correlation analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy Analysis**: Each classification model was evaluated for accuracy.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Used to assess model performance.
- **Best Model**: Support Vector Classifier was chosen due to its adaptability to non-linear data and strong accuracy.

## 📂 Project Files
- `Final_Project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and model implementation.
- `Student Dropout Data.csv` - Dataset used for analysis.
- `Final_Project.pptx` - Presentation summarizing project findings.

## 📌 Conclusion
While multiple models showed competitive performance, the **Support Vector Classifier** was found to be the most effective for predicting student dropout rates. Further analysis with cross-validation and impact assessment of false positives/negatives is recommended.
